# How the internet works
- ## How the data reach your phone or laptop
  - with the help of satellite: data is sent from data center to your mobile using satellite via an antenna, and then data is sent from satellitie to your phone via another antenna near to you. `` but that way  is not a good`` and the data is not sent to you in that way.
  -  data is sent to you using optical fiper cables
- ## ip address
  - unique identifier assigned to every device which is connected to the internet having its own ip address
  - that ip is given to your phone or laptop by ISP
  - sever in the data center also has an ip address
  - it is used to route data from the source device to destination deviece
- ## DNS & domain name & IP addresses
  - every IP address has its own domain name they are stored in DNS 
  - DNS is a hireachiccal system managed by ISP
- ## The whole operation happen when you request any page
  1- you enter the domain name
  2- your browser send a request to dns server to get the corresponding ip address
  3- your browser forward your request to the data center
  4- data flow starts from data center in a form of light pulses throw optical fieber cables 
  5- router converts light signals to electrical signal 
  6- electical signal transmit data to your laptop
- ## if you access the enternet throw mobile
  - light signal is sent to a cell tower and it reach to your phone in a form of electromagnatic wave
- ## manage internet around the world 
  - it is managed by ICANN located in the USA
- ## data sent from data center to you in the internet
  - it is sent in the form of huge collection of zeros and ones 
- ## protocols
  - Protocols are a set of rules and standards that govern the communication between devices on a network.
  - protocol used is diffrent from one applicaton to the other
  

# Geeks for geeks article
- ## packets & protocols
  - ### packets
    - data is divided into small segments which are divided into bits
    - what happen when i click in image? it is devided into parts that small parts starts to transmit to you, once all data are sent the image will appear to you
  - ### some protocols
  - ``iP``: Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol used for sending and receiving packets of data over the internet. It assigns a unique IP address to each device on the network, allowing them to communicate with each other.
  - ``TCP``: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a protocol used to ensure that packets of data are delivered in the correct order and without errors. It establishes a connection between two devices and uses a system of acknowledgments and retransmissions to ensure reliable delivery.
  -  ``HTTP``: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used for formatting data for websites and apps. It allows devices to request and receive web pages, images, and other content from servers on the internet.
  -  ``UDP``: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a protocol used for streaming games and videos. Unlike TCP, it does not guarantee reliable delivery or packet order, but it is faster and more efficient for real-time applications.
  -  ``SMTP`` used for email communication
